# Analysis Report: Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm

## Algorithm Overview

The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm is a highly efficient linear-time algorithm for finding the majority element in an array (element that appears more than n/2 times). It uses a two-phase approach with optimal O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity Analysis

**Best Case: Θ(n)**
- Must examine every element at least once in the candidate finding phase
- Even with early termination optimizations, requires linear scan

**Worst Case: Θ(n)**  
- Candidate finding: O(n) - single pass through array
- Verification phase: O(n) - second pass through array
- Total: O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

**Average Case: Θ(n)**
- Probabilistic optimizations can reduce constants but don't change asymptotic complexity
- Early termination in verification provides practical speedup

### Space Complexity Analysis

**Space Complexity: O(1)**
- Algorithm uses only constant extra variables (candidate, count)
- No auxiliary data structures that scale with input size
- Memory usage independent of array size

### Recurrence Relations

For the basic algorithm:
- T(n) = n (candidate finding) + n (verification) = 2n = O(n)

For optimized version with early termination:
- Best case: T(n) = n + k where k < n/2 (early termination)
- Worst case: T(n) = 2n (no early termination possible)

## Implementation Optimizations

1. **Early Termination in Verification**
   - Stop counting once majority threshold (n/2 + 1) is reached
   - Reduces average-case constant factors

2. **Probabilistic Pre-validation** 
   - Sample random positions for large arrays (n > 1000)
   - Skip full verification if sample suggests no majority
   - Maintains correctness while improving practical performance

3. **Memory Access Optimization**
   - Minimize array accesses by combining operations
   - Cache-friendly sequential access patterns

## Performance Characteristics

- **Scalability**: Excellent - truly linear time complexity
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimal - constant space usage
- **Cache Performance**: Good - sequential access patterns
- **Practical Performance**: Very fast due to simple operations

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Algorithm | Time | Space | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| Boyer-Moore | O(n) | O(1) | Optimal for majority finding |
| Naive Counting | O(n²) | O(1) | Simple but inefficient |
| Sorting-based | O(n log n) | O(1) | Return middle element |
| Hash Map | O(n) | O(n) | Good but uses extra space |

## Empirical Results

*Note: This section would be filled after running benchmarks with partner's Kadane's Algorithm implementation for comparison.*

## Conclusion

The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm represents an optimal solution for the majority element problem, achieving both optimal time and space complexity bounds. The implemented optimizations provide practical performance improvements while maintaining theoretical guarantees.
